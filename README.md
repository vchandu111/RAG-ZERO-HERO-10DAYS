# 🚀 10-Day RAG Beginner Roadmap

Welcome to your comprehensive learning journey into **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**! This repository is designed for absolute beginners who want to master RAG from the ground up in just 10 days.

## 📖 Description

This roadmap takes you from Python fundamentals all the way to building and deploying a complete RAG application. Each day builds upon the previous one, ensuring you have a solid foundation before moving to more advanced concepts. By the end of 10 days, you'll have hands-on experience with:

- Python programming for AI applications
- Large Language Models (LLMs) and their capabilities
- Prompt engineering techniques
- Data extraction and chunking strategies
- Vector embeddings and databases
- Building RAG systems from scratch
- Using frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex
- Advanced RAG techniques
- Deploying production-ready RAG applications

## 🎯 How to Use This Repository

1. **Study Day-by-Day**: Follow the roadmap sequentially, starting with Day 1
2. **Read the Notes**: Open each day's folder and read the `README.md` file thoroughly
3. **Complete Assignments**: Work through the `assignment.md` file for hands-on practice
4. **Practice Regularly**: Code along with the examples and complete all practice tasks
5. **Build Projects**: Each day includes a mini-project to reinforce your learning

### Recommended Study Schedule

- **Time per day**: 2-4 hours
- **Read notes**: 30-60 minutes
- **Complete assignments**: 1-2 hours
- **Mini project**: 30-60 minutes

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

### Python Version
- **Python 3.8 or higher** (Python 3.10+ recommended)

### Required Libraries

You'll install these progressively throughout the roadmap:

```bash
# Core libraries
pip install openai
pip install langchain
pip install llama-index
pip install chromadb
pip install sentence-transformers
pip install pypdf
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests
pip install fastapi
pip install streamlit
pip install uvicorn
```

### API Keys

You'll need API keys for certain days:

- **OpenAI API Key** (for Days 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
  - Sign up at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
  - Get your API key from the API keys section
  - Store it securely (use environment variables)

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## 💡 Learning Tips

1. **Don't Skip Days**: Each day builds on previous concepts
2. **Code Along**: Type out the examples yourself, don't just read
3. **Experiment**: Modify examples to see what happens
4. **Ask Questions**: If something is unclear, research it
5. **Take Notes**: Write down key concepts in your own words
6. **Build Projects**: The mini-projects are crucial for understanding

## 🎓 Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts (variables, functions, loops)
- Familiarity with command line/terminal
- Willingness to learn and experiment
- No prior AI/ML experience required!

## 📝 Notes

- All code examples are beginner-friendly
- Solutions are not provided for assignments (learning by doing!)
- You can work at your own pace, but try to complete one day per day
- Feel free to revisit previous days if needed
